# US Nuclear Plant Anki Deck

This is a flashcard deck for memorizing US nuclear power plants. It comes in the
form of an Anki flashcard deck. Anki is a program that uses Spaced Repetition
to help you learn and remember things.

At the moment this deck contains:

* Plant name
* Plant photo
* Location
* Type of reactor(s)
* Power levels
* Fun facts

Anki is 'self-graded', so you can use it to learn just the name/location
or the other fields as well, as you so desire.

All operational commercial US nuclear plants are loaded.

Cards with answers look like this:
